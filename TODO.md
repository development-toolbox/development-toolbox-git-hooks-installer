# TODO

- [ ] Publish Docker images to a public registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GHCR) when project matures.
- [ ] Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for local developer hooks (lint, format, etc).
- [ ] Expand integration tests to cover full git-hooks installation flow.
- [ ] Add more OS/Python/Git versions as they become available.
- [ ] Add CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests on pull requests.
