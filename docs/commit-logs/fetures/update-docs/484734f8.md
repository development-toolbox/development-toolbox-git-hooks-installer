  feat(installer): change branch naming from chore to feat

- Change branch type from chore/ to feat/ for git hooks updates
- Git hooks are features that add functionality, not maintenance tasks
- Update function documentation with clearer comments
- Add explanation for multi-component update scenario

Branch naming changes:
- chore/install-githooks-* → feat/install-githooks-*
- chore/update-git-hooks-* → feat/update-git-hooks-*
- chore/update-hook-scripts-* → feat/update-hook-scripts-*
- chore/update-githooks-installation-* → feat/update-githooks-installation-*
- chore/force-update-githooks-* → feat/force-update-githooks-*
- docs/update-githooks-docs-* remains unchanged (docs only)

Git hooks installation is a feature addition to the repository,
not a maintenance chore, that's why we had to change it.
