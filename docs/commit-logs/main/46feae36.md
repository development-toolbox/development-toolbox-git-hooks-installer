  feat(docs): comprehensive documentation restructure and v1.2.0 improvements

â€¢ Complete documentation restructure with logical organization:
  - docs/README.md: Main project overview and navigation
  - getting-started/: Installation, quick-start, and requirements
  - guides/: Authentication, troubleshooting, and security
  - reference/: CLI options, configuration, and API docs
  - development/: Architecture, contributing, and changelog

â€¢ Document v1.2.0 improvements:
  - Intelligent GitHub authentication (token + gh CLI)
  - Automatic PR creation with fallback mechanisms
  - Interactive setup for missing authentication
  - Automatic branch restoration to preserve workflow
  - File exclusion filtering (__pycache__, .pyc, hidden files)

â€¢ Enhanced installer features:
  - Fixed __pycache__ file conflicts with .gitignore
  - Added smart GitHub auth detection (token > gh CLI > interactive)
  - Implemented automatic return to original branch
  - Added comprehensive error handling and recovery
  - Improved developer experience with non-disruptive workflow

â€¢ Security and architecture documentation:
  - Complete threat model and defense-in-depth design
  - Security best practices and vulnerability mitigation
  - Comprehensive troubleshooting with real solutions
  - Technical architecture for developers and contributors
