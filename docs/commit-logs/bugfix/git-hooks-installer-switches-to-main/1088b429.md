  # ðŸš€ chore(githooks): Refactor, Whitespace Cleanup & Add Commit Utility

This update brings a series of improvements and new utilities to the git-hooks-installer project, focusing on code quality, maintainability, and future automation.

---

## âœ¨ Highlights

- **refactor(logging):**
  Improved logging formatting and efficiency in `git-hooks-installer.py` by switching to argument-based logging and reducing line length.

- **style:**
  Removed all trailing whitespace and ensured all blank lines are truly empty in `git-hooks-installer.py` and related scripts.
  _Addresses flake8 and pylint warnings for whitespace and blank lines._

- **feat(commit_file.py):**
  Introduced a new utility module, `commit_file.py`, providing a function to stage and commit a file with a message using subprocess.
  _This utility is intended for future use in automation scripts and git hooks to enable programmatic commits._

- **docs:**
  Updated comments and documentation throughout the codebase to clarify intent, improve maintainability, and ensure compliance with style guidelines (PEP8, pylint, flake8).

- **fix:**
  Addressed several linter warnings, including blank lines, trailing whitespace, and long lines, to improve code readability and consistency.

- **misc:**
  General code and documentation improvements for maintainability, style compliance, and future extensibility.
