  feat(test,ci,docs): add Docker-based testing environment, HTML test results, and AI chat log instructions

- Add Dockerfiles for Ubuntu, AlmaLinux 9, and AlmaLinux 10 with Python 3.12+ and code quality tools
- Add docker-compose.yml for multi-platform test runs
- Add requirements.txt for test/code quality dependencies (now includes pytest-html for HTML reports)
- Add run_all.sh to run lint, type, security, and test checks in containers, saving all results as HTML and text files in tests/results/
- Add sample unit and integration tests
- Add Makefile for easy test execution via Docker
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md with test/code quality instructions
- Add TODO.md for future improvements (Docker image publishing, pre-commit, CI, etc.)
- Add install_docker_almalinux10.sh and debug_docker_service.sh scripts for Docker setup and troubleshooting
- Add ai-conversation-history.md and instructions for saving and continuing AI chat logs in docs/ai-history/

All test and code quality results are now saved in tests/results/ as HTML and text files for easy review.
AI chat log and context are now documented for continuity between assistants.
This sets up a comprehensive, reproducible test environment for the project.
