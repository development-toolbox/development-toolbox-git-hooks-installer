| 🖥️   | **ui:** Refactored the code-style-tutorial site to use a modern, consistent layout with header, footer, and responsive card-based navigation. |
| 🗂️   | **structure:** Split header and footer into reusable files for maintainability and consistent look across all tutorial pages. |
| 🏷️   | **navigation:** Improved navigation with in-page anchors, sectioned menus, and visually appealing cards for each topic. |
| 🖤   | **black:** Added a dedicated Black section with usage, VS Code integration, pre-commit, and CI/CD pages, all with TOC and backlinks. |
