  fix(installer): major bugfixes and add developer setup scripts

Major fixes to git-hooks-installer.py (v8.5):
- Fix merge target to use current branch instead of always merging to main/master
- Stay on current branch when creating update branch (no unnecessary switching)
- Add cleanup for failed merges with git merge --abort
- Update push messages to reflect correct target branch
- Update manual merge instructions to use original branch

Add developer onboarding scripts:
- Add setup-githooks.sh for Unix/macOS developers
- Add setup-githooks.ps1 for Windows developers
- Add SETUP-GITHOOKS.md documentation
- Scripts install exact post-commit hook with version tracking (v0.5)
- Include recursion prevention, commit logs, timeline generation
- Smart version checking - won't overwrite newer hooks
- Check Python, pip, git config, and dependencies
- Embed version in hook header for tracking

Add install_developer_setup_files() function:
- Copies setup scripts to repository root
- Makes shell scripts executable
- Allows new developers to setup hooks with ./setup-githooks.sh

Version tracking improvements:
- Add EXPECTED_VERSION variable in setup scripts
- Embed version in installed hook headers
- Check existing hooks before reinstalling
- Prompt user before replacing modified hooks

Breaking change:
- Installer now merges to current branch, not default branch
- This is the correct behavior but changes previous workflow

Fixes #1: Merge to wrong branch
Fixes #2: Unnecessary branch switching
Fixes #3: No developer setup process
Fixes #4: No version tracking in hooks
