## Version History Summary

| Version | Release Date | Key Features | Security Level |
|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1.2.0 | 2024-08-16 | Auto PR creation, GitHub auth, workflow improvements | High |
| 1.1.0 | 2024-07-15 | Security hardening, protection controls | Very High |
| 1.0.0 | 2024-06-01 | Initial release, basic functionality | Medium |

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0

**Automatic Migration**: No manual intervention required. The installer automatically detects and uses the new features.

**New Features Available**:
```bash
# Set up GitHub token for automatic PR creation
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Run installer - it will automatically create PR and return to your branch
python git-hooks-installer.py /path/to/repo
```

**Breaking Changes**: None - fully backward compatible

### Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

**Security Improvements**: Automatic - all security enhancements are applied automatically.

**New Validation**: The installer now performs more thorough pre-flight checks. Ensure:
- Repository has clean working tree
- No sensitive files in repository root
- Proper Git configuration

**Resource Limits**: New limits are in effect:
- Maximum 1000 files per installation
- Maximum 100MB total size
- 30-second timeout on Git operations

## Deprecation Notices

### Deprecated in 1.2.0
- None

### Deprecated in 1.1.0
- **Legacy installer mode**: Direct commit mode (without PR) is discouraged for security
- **Unvalidated file operations**: All file operations now require validation

### Removed in 1.1.0
- **Direct main branch commits**: Now requires PR workflow
- **Unprotected Git operations**: All Git commands now use SecureGitWrapper
