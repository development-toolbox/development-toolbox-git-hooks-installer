# Fix Path Detection Logic in setup_githooks.py

**Date Created**: 2025-07-24  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PENDING - Investigation Required  
**Priority**: Medium  

## Task Description

Investigate and fix potential path detection issues in the `setup_githooks.py` script that were identified during the installer analysis.

## Background

During the comprehensive installer fixes, path detection logic was mentioned as needing attention in the developer setup script located at:
- `git-hooks-installer/developer-setup/setup_githooks.py`

## Issues to Investigate

1. **Path Resolution**: Check if the script correctly detects:
   - Repository root directory
   - Git hooks directory location
   - Template files location
   - Python script paths

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure paths work on:
   - Windows (backslash separators)
   - Linux/macOS (forward slash separators)
   - Different drive letters on Windows

3. **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios like:
   - Script run from subdirectories
   - Symlinked directories
   - Spaces in path names
   - Non-ASCII characters in paths

## Current File Location

```
git-hooks-installer/
â””â”€â”€ developer-setup/
    â”œâ”€â”€ setup_githooks.py          # <- This file needs investigation
    â”œâ”€â”€ SETUP-GITHOOKS.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
    â””â”€â”€ templates/
        â””â”€â”€ post-commit
```

## Investigation Plan

1. **Code Review**: Analyze current path detection implementation
2. **Test Scenarios**: Create test cases for different path situations
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Validate on Windows and Linux
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with problematic path names

## Expected Deliverables

- [ ] Analysis report of current path detection logic
- [ ] Identification of specific issues (if any)
- [ ] Fixed implementation (if needed)
- [ ] Test cases to validate path detection
- [ ] Documentation of path handling approach

## Testing Approach

Once fixes are implemented:
1. Test from different working directories
2. Test with paths containing spaces
3. Test on both Windows and Linux environments
4. Validate with the existing Docker test infrastructure

## Dependencies

- Requires the fixed installer to be working (âœ… Complete)
- May need updates to Docker test infrastructure for validation

## Status

PENDING - Needs initial investigation to determine scope of required fixes.

**This task requires investigation before implementation. Should I proceed with analyzing the setup_githooks.py file?**
