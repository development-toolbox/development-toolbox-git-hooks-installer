# Developer Setup Version Synchronization

**Date Created:** 2025-07-25
**Status:** ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS - Updating standalone developer setup script
**Priority:** High

## Issue Analysis

**Problem:** Version mismatch between main installer and developer setup script
- Main installer: `git-hooks-installer.py` v1.0.0 
- Developer setup: `setup_githooks.py` v0.5
- User confusion when setup script shows older version

**Root Cause:** 
- `setup_githooks.py` is designed to be standalone (per CLAUDE.md requirements)
- Must be self-contained and work without main installer dependencies
- But version got out of sync during main installer development

## CLAUDE.md Requirements

From architecture documentation:
```
2. **Developer Setup** (`git-hooks-installer/developer-setup/`)
   - **Critical**: This folder MUST be copied to target repositories
   - Contains setup scripts for developers to manually install hooks
   - Includes `setup_githooks.py` for interactive configuration
```

**Design Intent:**
- **Decoupled architecture** - Developer setup exists independently in target repos
- **No imports from main installer** - Must work standalone
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on any computer/OS
- **Version consistency** - Should match main installer version for clarity

## Tasks Required

### 1. Version Update âœ… (In Progress)
- Change `INSTALLER_VERSION = "0.5"` â†’ `"1.0.0"`
- Update all version references in output messages
- Ensure version detection logic handles both versions correctly

### 2. Message Improvements
- Clearer explanation when main installer already used
- Better guidance for developers on different computers
- Consistent terminology with main installer

### 3. Standalone Validation
- Ensure no dependencies on main installer modules
- Verify works in target repositories without installer present
- Test cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS)

## User Story Context

**Use Case:** Developer switches between computers and repositories
- Wants simple way to activate git hooks on any machine
- May not have access to main installer repository
- Needs to verify current installation status
- Should get clear guidance on next steps

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Run `./setup_githooks.py` in any repository
2. If main installer v1.0.0 already used â†’ Show status, no action needed
3. If no hooks or older version â†’ Provide manual setup option
4. Clear version information and guidance

## Files Modified

- `developer-setup/setup_githooks.py` - Version bump and message improvements

## Testing Plan

1. Test in repository with main installer v1.0.0 already installed
2. Test in fresh repository with no hooks
3. Test version detection logic with different scenarios
4. Verify cross-platform Unicode output (Windows emoji fix)

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Version consistency (1.0.0 across both tools)
- âœ… Clear messaging when newer version detected  
- âœ… Standalone operation (no main installer dependencies)
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility
- âœ… User confusion eliminated
